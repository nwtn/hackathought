== Description ==
This plugin creates a new library that is used to interact with the API of other Ushahidi sites. The helper handles all of the parsing and creating of API requests. This Library is not the API itself. It just makes using the API easier.

This is made for Ushahidi sites that need to interact with other Ushahidi sites in a programatic way.

This supports the Report, Incidents, Categories, and API Key tasks.

!!!!  REQUIRES PHP 5.3  !!!!!

== Installation ==

1. Copy the entire /ushahidiapilibrary/ directory into your /plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin.
3. create a new Ushahidi_API_Library object in your code and then go to town.
